# ideas for test doc:
# 1. student waits for courier for watcard (it already purchased with giftcard)
# 2. student waits for giftcard
# 3. multiple students one courier and one vending machine (2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 3, 3, 10, 5, 1)
# 4. Students having to busy wait because of slow restocking (large delay in shipment)
# 5. Soda cost greater than 5 requiring more transfer of funds from parent
# 6. Big delay in parents deliverying money, multiple couriers blocking waiting for parent
# 7. Multiple shipments by truck because MaxShippedPerFlavour is so small
